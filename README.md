Introduction
============
The specification is avaiable [here](javalette).

This project has been developed using [stack] and all commands
casually assumes that you will too.

Building
========
Lexing and parsing has been implemented using bnfc. The syntax-file
can be converted using:

    bin/dobnfc.sh

But (much against my good will) the code that is generated by this
is version-controlled as well, so stack should be the only thing
you need to get up and running. Thus; building is as easy as 1... 2...

    stack build

Running
=======
This projects defines two executables `jlc` and `javalette-parser`.

`javalette-parser` is an executable generated by `bnfc`. `jlc` is
the main executable that implements the compiler. As of now it does
not have a lot of sophisticated options. It expects a single
mandatory argument that is the path to a javalette-file. It will
then type-check it and write eiher "OK" or "ERROR" to stderr.

Testing
=======
Tests are performed as described in the [spec](javalette-testing).

Simply supply the location to where directory where the binary `jlc`
ends up. With stack this is a (somewhat awkward) one-liner:

    Grade `stack path --project-root`/`stack path --dist-dir`/build/jlc
